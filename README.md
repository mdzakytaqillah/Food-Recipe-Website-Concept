# Food-Recipe-Website-Concept
The concept of a web-based food recipe application. This website is called 'MahaResep' and was created to fulfill the assignment for the Web Programming course.
# Timeline
- Planning (October 13, 2024 - October 15, 2024)
  Conducting discussions with the team to determine the web application to be developed. It was decided to develop a food recipe application by considering the benefits, complexity, and security.
  A food recipe website can be useful because users can get cooking references and can also share their food recipes just by accessing the website and do not need to install additional applications.
  In addition, the food recipe website has a simple function. Users can even view existing recipes without logging in or registering an account.
  To be able to share recipes, mark existing recipes, and access other features, users are required to have an account and log in to the website. However, to register on this website, users only need to enter their name, username, and password. Users are not asked for personal data, email, and are not prohibited from using pseudonyms.
- Design (October 16, 2024 - November 4, 2024)
  Create website display designs and ensure the display is responsive to various device sizes.
- Function and Database Development (December 4, 2024 - December 15, 2024)
  Building databases and developing application functions and ensuring that the functions can run well according to expectations.
- Testing and Fixing (December 21, 2024 - December 31, 2024)
  Conduct web application testing to check for errors and existing problems and make improvements to any problems found.
